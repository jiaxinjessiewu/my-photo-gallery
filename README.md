## About the application

My-photo-gallery is a photo search application build with Angular framework and Flickr API, which also uses [ngx-infinite-scroll](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-infinite-scroll) to load more photos when the user is scrolling down. The app also allows users upload and store images in Firebase and use Firebase Realtime Database to see the files that are uploaded in real time.
